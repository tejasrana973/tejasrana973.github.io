        <p>I am currently pursuing a BS-MS dual degree in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), with an expected graduation in 2025. My research interests lie at the intersection of experimental particle physics, precision measurements, and the application of modern computational techniques to fundamental physics problems.</p>

        <p>My primary research focus is on the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) experiment at Fermilab, one of the most precise measurements in particle physics. The muon g-2 experiment probes the Standard Model at its limits, with recent results showing a tantalizing discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. I am contributing to the analysis of systematic uncertainties and the development of improved fitting techniques for the precession frequency extraction.</p>

        <p>Beyond my thesis work, I have a strong interest in applying machine learning methods to particle physics data analysis. I have experience with event classification, background rejection, and anomaly detection using neural networks. I believe that these computational tools will play an increasingly important role in extracting physics from the large datasets produced by modern experiments.</p>

        <p>I am currently applying to PhD programs in experimental particle physics for Fall 2025. I am particularly interested in precision measurements at the intensity and energy frontiers, including projects at CERN, Fermilab, and other major laboratories. My goal is to contribute to experiments that test the Standard Model and search for new physics through precision measurements.</p>

        <p>On this website, you will find my CV with details of my education, research experience, and technical skills. The Master Thesis section contains a summary of my ongoing thesis work, including the mathematical framework, preliminary results, and sample visualizations. All analysis code and documentation are available on my GitHub.</p>
