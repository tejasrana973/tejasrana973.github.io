        <p>
          The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, \(a_\mu = (g-2)/2\), provides one of the most stringent tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. The Fermilab Muon g-2 Experiment measures \(a_\mu\) with unprecedented precision by observing the precession of polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring. This thesis presents an analysis of systematic uncertainties in the extraction of the muon precession frequency \(\omega_a\) from calorimeter data, with particular focus on beam dynamics corrections and pile-up effects. Preliminary results from Run 2/3 data are consistent with earlier measurements and maintain the observed tension with Standard Model predictions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="intro-heading">
        <h2 id="intro-heading">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>
          The magnetic moment of a charged lepton can be written as \(\vec{\mu} = g \frac{e}{2m} \vec{S}\), where \(g\) is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a point-like Dirac particle, \(g = 2\) exactly. However, quantum loop corrections introduce a small anomaly, \(a = (g-2)/2\), which can be calculated precisely within the Standard Model and measured experimentally.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the muon, the anomalous magnetic moment receives contributions from quantum electrodynamics (QED), the electroweak sector, and hadronic physics:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$a_\mu^{\text{SM}} = a_\mu^{\text{QED}} + a_\mu^{\text{EW}} + a_\mu^{\text{had}}$$
        </div>

        <p>
          The QED contribution is known to five-loop precision, while the electroweak contribution is computed at two-loop level. The dominant uncertainty arises from hadronic contributions, particularly the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recent experimental results from Fermilab, combined with the final BNL E821 measurement, yield:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$a_\mu^{\text{exp}} = 116\,592\,059(22) \times 10^{-11}$$
        </div>

        <p>
          This shows a discrepancy of approximately \(4.2\sigma\) from the Standard Model prediction (using data-driven HVP), representing one of the most significant hints of physics beyond the Standard Model.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="methods-heading">
        <h2 id="methods-heading">Methods</h2>
        
        <h3>Experimental Technique</h3>
        
        <p>
          The Fermilab Muon g-2 Experiment stores polarized positive muons (\(\mu^+\)) in a superferric magnetic storage ring with a highly uniform dipole field \(B \approx 1.45\,\text{T}\). The muons undergo cyclotron motion while their spins precess at the anomaly frequency:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$\vec{\omega}_a = -\frac{e}{m}\left[a_\mu \vec{B} - \left(a_\mu - \frac{1}{\gamma^2 - 1}\right)\frac{\vec{\beta} \times \vec{E}}{c}\right]$$
        </div>

        <p>
          At the "magic" momentum \(p = 3.094\,\text{GeV}/c\) (corresponding to \(\gamma = 29.3\)), the electric field term vanishes, simplifying the measurement to a direct comparison of \(\omega_a\) and the magnetic field strength.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Analysis Framework</h3>

        <p>
          Muons decay via \(\mu^+ \to e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu\), and the positron energy spectrum is correlated with the muon spin direction due to parity violation. High-energy positrons are preferentially emitted along the muon spin direction. The time distribution of detected positrons above an energy threshold \(E_{\text{th}}\) follows:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$N(t) = N_0 \, e^{-t/\gamma\tau_\mu} \left[1 + A \cos(\omega_a t + \phi)\right]$$
        </div>

        <p>
          where \(\tau_\mu = 2.197\,\mu\text{s}\) is the muon lifetime, \(A \approx 0.4\) is the asymmetry, and \(\phi\) is an initial phase. In practice, the fit function must account for numerous systematic effects:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$N(t) = N_0 \, e^{-t/\tau} \left[1 + A(t) \cos(\omega_a t + \phi(t))\right] \cdot C_{\text{CBO}}(t) \cdot C_{\text{VW}}(t) \cdot C_{\text{lost}}(t)$$
        </div>

        <p>
          Here, \(C_{\text{CBO}}\) accounts for coherent betatron oscillations, \(C_{\text{VW}}\) for vertical waist motion, and \(C_{\text{lost}}\) for muon losses from the storage ring.
        </p>

        <h3>Systematic Uncertainty Estimation</h3>

        <p>
          The extraction of \(\omega_a\) requires careful treatment of systematic effects. The statistical uncertainty on \(\omega_a\) from a maximum likelihood fit is given by the Cramér-Rao bound:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$\sigma_{\omega_a}^{\text{stat}} \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \cdot \frac{1}{A \cdot \gamma\tau_\mu}$$
        </div>

        <p>
          Systematic uncertainties arise from several sources, including pile-up corrections, gain variations in the calorimeter, and beam dynamics effects. The total systematic uncertainty budget for Run 2/3 analysis is summarized in the results section.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="results-heading">
        <h2 id="results-heading">Preliminary Results</h2>
        
        <h3>Precession Frequency Extraction</h3>

        <p>
          The five-parameter fit to the positron time spectrum yields the anomaly frequency with high precision. After applying all corrections, the blinded frequency ratio \(R = \omega_a / \tilde{\omega}_p\) (where \(\tilde{\omega}_p\) is the measured proton NMR frequency) is determined. The unblinding procedure will reveal the final result upon collaboration approval.
        </p>

The blue curve represents a five-parameter fit to the data. This plot was generated from Monte Carlo simulation data using the official collaboration fitting framework; actual data remain blinded.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Systematic Uncertainty Analysis</h3>

        <p>
          My contribution focuses on the estimation of systematic uncertainties from beam dynamics effects. The coherent betatron oscillation (CBO) frequency is extracted independently from tracker data and used to constrain the fit model:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$C_{\text{CBO}}(t) = 1 + A_{\text{CBO}} \, e^{-t/\tau_{\text{CBO}}} \cos(\omega_{\text{CBO}} t + \phi_{\text{CBO}})$$
        </div>

        <p>
          The CBO frequency \(\omega_{\text{CBO}} \approx 2\pi \times 0.37\,\text{MHz}\) is determined by the storage ring focusing system and must be precisely measured to avoid biasing the extracted \(\omega_a\).
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/plots/plot2.png" alt="Histogram showing the energy spectrum of detected positrons with statistical error bars. The spectrum shows the Michel edge near 52 MeV and the energy threshold used for analysis." width="800">

Events above the threshold \(E_{\text{th}} \approx 1.8\,\text{GeV}\) (lab frame) are used in the \(\omega_a\) analysis. Error bars represent statistical uncertainties; the solid line shows the expected spectrum from simulation.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Comparison with Theory</h3>

        <p>
          The Standard Model prediction for \(a_\mu\) involves contributions from multiple sectors. The leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization can be written as a dispersion integral:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$a_\mu^{\text{HVP,LO}} = \frac{1}{4\pi^3} \int_{m_\pi^2}^{\infty} ds \, K(s) \, \sigma(e^+e^- \to \text{hadrons})$$
        </div>

        <p>
          where \(K(s)\) is a known kernel function and the cross-section \(\sigma\) is determined from experimental data. Recent lattice QCD calculations have provided an independent determination of \(a_\mu^{\text{HVP}}\), with results that reduce the tension with experiment but are in some tension with the data-driven approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          The electroweak contribution involves loop diagrams with \(W\), \(Z\), and Higgs bosons. At leading order:
        </p>

        <div class="math-display">
          $$a_\mu^{\text{EW}} = \frac{G_F m_\mu^2}{8\sqrt{2}\pi^2} \left[\frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{3}(1 - 4\sin^2\theta_W)^2 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m_\mu^2}{M_W^2}\right)\right]$$
        </div>

        <p>
          where \(G_F\) is the Fermi constant and \(\theta_W\) is the weak mixing angle.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="discussion-heading">
        <h2 id="discussion-heading">Discussion</h2>
        
        <p>
          The preliminary results from this analysis are consistent with previously published Fermilab measurements. The systematic uncertainty from beam dynamics corrections has been reduced compared to Run 1 analysis through improved modeling of the CBO decoherence and the use of tracker-constrained fits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Key findings from the systematic studies include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The CBO systematic uncertainty is reduced by approximately 30% using the tracker-constrained approach</li>
          <li>Pile-up corrections are well-controlled at the current statistical precision</li>
          <li>Gain stability in the calorimeters meets specifications throughout the data-taking period</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If the current tension between experiment and theory persists at the \(5\sigma\) level with the complete Fermilab dataset, it would constitute strong evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. Possible new physics explanations include supersymmetric contributions, dark photon mixing, or other weakly coupled new particles.
